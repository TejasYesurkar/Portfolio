The original template has been completely rewritten as an Angular project with routing and custom project pages. 

For details on how to run the project or make modifications for your own needs, see the Angular CLI instructions below. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
